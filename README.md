## Purpose
The main aim of this project is to re-implement ADAM in PyTorch and test the claims made by the paper - [Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)
In addition to that, we also implemented a visualizer to visualize the performance of different optimizers on various 3 dimensional terrains like saddle points, the rosenbrock function and unequal minima.
